PLEASE READ:

You can skip the tests execution using "//skip-ci" anywhere in the pull request description.
To run a particular tag, use following syntax: //test: `@mytag`. In this scenario it will result in running "(@mytag) or @smoke", otherwise, by default, only @smoke tag is triggered.

Unless you want to skip tests (//skip-ci):
1) do not directly request review from anyone
2) use 'Draft' PR until the tests pass and you are satisfied with all the content - then mark the PR as "Ready for review"
